# Why I Started This Site

Creating this site was something I’ve been meaning to do for a while. As a Computer Science student, I’ve built many things — but rarely paused to document or reflect on them publicly. This site is my attempt to change that.

## What You’ll Find Here

I plan to post:

- Quick writeups about projects I’m working on
- Short tutorials or tricks I’ve discovered
- Thoughts on software, learning, and productivity
- Occasional fun stuff (cats, photography, etc.)

## Why Hugo?

I chose Hugo because:

- It’s **blazing fast**
- I enjoy writing in *Markdown*
- Static sites are lightweight, clean, and low-maintenance

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/pan1018) or connect with me elsewhere.
