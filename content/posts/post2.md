# 3 Coding Habits I Swear By

Over time, I've developed a few simple habits that help me stay productive and sane while coding. Here are my top 3:

## 1. Write it Down First

Before jumping into code, I write out what I’m trying to build — in plain English. Whether it's a function, a feature, or a bug fix, describing it clearly usually saves time debugging later.

## 2. Git Early, Git Often

Version control is not just for big projects. I try to:

- Commit small and often
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Never push broken code to `main`

**Bold tip**: Branch names like `fix/login-redirect` or `feature/image-upload` make life easier.

## 3. Don't Fear the Terminal

I used to rely on GUIs, but the terminal is now my best friend. Some of my most-used commands are:

```bash
git log --oneline
grep -r "functionName" .
htop
