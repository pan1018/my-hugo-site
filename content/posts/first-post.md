# 👋 Hello and Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my site! I’m thrilled to share this small corner of the internet where I can post thoughts, showcase projects, and keep track of things I’ve learned or built.

Whether you're a friend, fellow student, or just curious about Hugo static sites — **you’re in the right place.**

## 🛠️ What is This Site?

This site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a super-fast static site generator written in Go. It’s designed to be simple, clean, and efficient — perfect for a lightweight personal site.

I chose [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) as the theme because:
- It’s minimalist, yet stylish ✨
- Easy to customize
- Loads *blazingly* fast
